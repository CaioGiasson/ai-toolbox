## What this repository is

A Claude Code **plugin marketplace** named `cainitech`, with two plugins in a single repository:

| Plugin | Skills | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `checkup` | `security`, `performance`, `privacy`, `ai-readiness`, `full` | Read-only application assessments: 512 criteria, a 0–100 score, a classification and a prioritized backlog. |
| `spec` | `refine`, `from-thread`, `build`, `review`, `approve` | Task workflow from idea to merge. Uses a GitHub Project board when the project has one, always records the work in the project docs, and adapts to GitHub / Git without GitHub / other VCS / no VCS. |

Skills are invoked as `/<plugin>:<skill>` (for example `/checkup:security`, `/spec:refine`).

## Install from the terminal

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add CaioGiasson/cainitech-plugins
claude plugin install checkup@cainitech
claude plugin install spec@cainitech
```

Inside a session the equivalents are `/plugin marketplace add CaioGiasson/cainitech-plugins` and `/plugin install checkup@cainitech`. In VS Code, type `/plugins` to open **Manage plugins**. Add `--scope project` to enable a plugin for everyone who works in a given repository.

Updates: `claude plugin marketplace update cainitech` followed by `claude plugin update <plugin>@cainitech`. Auto-update is off by default for third-party marketplaces; turn it on in `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** → **Enable auto-update**.

Local development without installing: `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/checkup --plugin-dir ./plugins/spec`.

## How a skill finds its shared files

Plugins are copied to a cache when installed, and a plugin cannot read files outside its own folder. So each plugin carries everything it needs, and skills reference bundled files with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which Claude Code substitutes inline in the Markdown of a skill:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ASSESSMENT.md
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/security/references/checklist.md
```

Why the guidelines and catalogs are **separate files and not inside `SKILL.md`**: a skill's body is loaded when the skill is invoked, but files it points to are read only when the skill asks for them. The 200 KB of catalogs therefore cost nothing until an assessment actually runs, and `/checkup:security` reads only its own catalog. Keep `SKILL.md` short and procedural; put reference material in `references/`.

Shared material is deliberately **not** duplicated across plugins: `checkup` and `spec` are independent. `spec` never depends on `checkup`, and `checkup` only mentions `/spec:refine` as an optional next step.

## Language behavior

Every user-facing skill has a **Language** rule: detect the user's language from `$ARGUMENTS` and recent messages, answer and write all artifacts in it, and use **English** when it cannot be determined. The instruction files themselves are in English. For the assessment reports, item IDs, file paths, code and the classification names (Dangerous, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) stay untranslated.

## Assessment catalogs

- The `skills/*/references/checklist.md` files are now the **source of truth** (there is no generator script anymore). Edit them directly.
- **Never change an item ID, severity or weight casually**: score comparison between runs depends on them. If you must, record it in the pull request and the plugin changelog.
- Expected totals: security 153 (48 critical · 89 important · 16 minor), performance 163 (9 · 82 · 72), privacy 126 (37 · 66 · 23), ai-readiness 70 (6 · 30 · 34). Their counts must keep adding up to 512.
- Report format, statuses, weights and classification thresholds live in `plugins/checkup/references/ASSESSMENT.md`.

## The `spec` workflow rules

`plugins/spec/references/WORKFLOW.md` is read first by every skill of the plugin. Summary:

- **Tracker detection:** explicit instruction → GitHub Project board linked to the repository → another tracker with a connected tool → none. With a board, tasks are created and moved there; without, nothing is created in a tracker.
- **Mandatory documentation record:** every refinement is saved in the project's docs folder under `specs/` (`<id>-<slug>.md`), with or without a board, unless the user explicitly says not to document.
- **Delivery modes:** A (GitHub: branch, commits, PR, review, merge) · B (Git without GitHub: local branch and merge) · C (other VCS) · D (no VCS: a `<refinement>.changelog.<ext>` file with a copy of every change).
- **Versioning:** at most one version bump per PR/branch, only if the project already versions itself.
- The project's own conventions always win over anything generic in the plugin.

## Adding a skill

1. Create `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with the frontmatter below. The folder name is the skill name.
2. Put long reference material in `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/references/` and reference it with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/references/<file>`.
3. Add the Language rule if the skill talks to the user.
4. Validate (see below), bump the plugin `version`, commit.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "One or two sentences. Always wrap in double quotes: an unquoted colon breaks the YAML."
---

# Skill: my-skill
...
```

## Adding a plugin

Create `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `plugins/<name>/skills/…`, then add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `"source": "./plugins/<name>"`. The entry `name` and the manifest `name` must be identical. Plugin names must be kebab-case and cannot start with `claude-`, `anthropic-` or similar reserved prefixes. **Never rename a published plugin**: installs are recorded under the old name. Use the marketplace `renames` map if you have to.

## Validation and release

```bash
claude plugin validate .                    # marketplace
claude plugin validate plugins/checkup   # plugin manifest and skills
claude plugin validate plugins/spec
```

Because `version` is set in each `plugin.json`, users only receive an update when you **increase it** (`claude plugin update` reports "already at the latest version" otherwise). Bump the version of every plugin you changed in the same pull request. Optionally tag releases with `claude plugin tag`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs these validations on every pull request, pinned to a Claude Code version, and also checks that the catalogs keep their item counts (153 / 163 / 126 / 70, unique IDs) and that every `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` reference points to an existing file. Bump the pinned version when you want newer validation.

Note: the validator of older Claude Code versions rejects some newer optional manifest fields (for example `displayName` or a marketplace-level `description`), so the manifests here stick to the fields every version understands.
