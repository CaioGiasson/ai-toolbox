# Shared workflow rules — `spec` plugin

Every skill of this plugin (`refine`, `from-thread`, `build`, `review`, `approve`) reads this file first (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/WORKFLOW.md`). It defines what is common to all of them: language, project context, task tracker detection, mandatory documentation, versioning and tooling. A rule here wins over a more specific phrasing in a skill only when the skill says so.

---

## 1. Language

- Detect the user's language from `$ARGUMENTS` and their most recent messages. Use it for everything you say in the chat and for everything you write for people: issues, refinement documents, PR descriptions, review comments, changelog files and commit messages.
- If you cannot determine the language, use **English**.
- Commit messages and branch names: follow the project's existing history and conventions first (`git log`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`); only if there is none, use the user's language (or English when undetermined) with Conventional Commits prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).
- Code identifiers, file names and commands stay in the language the codebase already uses.
- Fixed markers that other skills look for (section titles such as `## Order of commits`, `## 🤖 Prompt for Claude`) are written in the detected language, but each skill that reads them must accept the English and the localized variant.

## 2. Project context

Before acting on a repository:

1. Read `tasks/lessons.md` if it exists (lessons learned: apply them).
2. Read the project's own context and convention files, when they exist: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `docs/` index, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, issue templates, lint/format/test configuration.
3. **The project's rules win.** This plugin imposes no stack, naming style or architecture. If the user has personal guidelines (for example files under `~/.claude/guidelines/`), read the ones that apply, but the project's own rules still win on conflict.
4. If the project has no written conventions, infer them from the code and the git history, and follow them. Do not introduce a new style.

If a corrective lesson comes up during the work (the user corrects you, or a non-obvious pitfall appears), add it to `tasks/lessons.md` (symptom → cause → prevention) when the project keeps that file.

## 3. Task tracker detection

"Tracker" means the place where the project's tasks live. The default tracker is a **GitHub Project board** linked to the repository, with GitHub Issues as the tasks.

Detect in this order and stop at the first that applies:

1. **Explicit instruction:** the user names a tracker/board, or the project docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`) state which one is used.
2. **GitHub board:** the repository has a GitHub remote (`git remote -v` contains `github.com`), GitHub access is available (see §6) and there is at least one GitHub Project linked to the repository or its owner. Check with:
   - `gh project list --owner <owner>` and `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/projects` / the GraphQL `projectsV2` of the repository;
   - if the issue already belongs to a project, that project is the board.
   If there is more than one candidate, ask the user once which to use (offer the detected ones) and suggest recording the choice in the project docs.
3. **Another tracker:** if the project docs name another tracker (Linear, Jira, GitLab…) **and** a connected tool for it is available in the session, use it. Otherwise treat as "no board".

Result:

- **Board found** → create the tasks there, move them as the work progresses (§3.1) **and** keep the documentation record (§4).
- **No board** → do **not** create tasks anywhere; the documentation record (§4) is the deliverable. Say so in one line and mention that the user can ask for a plain GitHub issue if they want one.

Never create or modify a board, a project, labels or fields the project did not already have, except a single missing label needed for a task (ask first) and the `Reviewed` label used by `approve`.

### 3.1 Board status

When a board exists, status moves are: `ToDo` on creation → `In Progress` when `build` begins → `Review` when the PR opens → `Done` when `approve` merges. Match option names ignoring case and spaces, accepting equivalents (`Todo`, `Backlog`; `In review`; `Done`, `Closed`). Moving the status needs the `project` scope in `gh` (`gh auth refresh -s project`). If an option does not exist or the move fails, warn in one line and continue.

## 4. Mandatory documentation record

**Every refinement is recorded in the project's documentation folder, with or without a board.** The only exception is an **explicit instruction from the user not to document** in this conversation; without that, the record is never optional.

- **Where:** the project's existing documentation folder (`docs/`, `doc/`, `documentation/`, `wiki/`…), in a subfolder `specs/` (create it if missing). If the project has no documentation folder, create `docs/specs/`. If the project has an index (`docs/README.md`, `docs/specs/README.md`), add an entry.
- **File name:** `<id>-<slug>.md`, where `<id>` is the task number when a tracker task exists, or the date `YYYY-MM-DD` when there is none. `<slug>` is the title in lowercase-kebab-case. This file is the **refinement document**.
- **Content:** a header (title, date, branch if known, links to the task(s)), then the **full** refinement: objective, context, business rules, acceptance criteria, main flow, edge cases, implementation definitions per repository, order of commits, test script, documentation to update and the implementation prompt. Never summarize or drop sections.
- **Multi-repository work:** one refinement document per repository, in that repository's docs folder, plus the overview in the repository that owns the main task.
- Update the document when the plan changes during implementation (note what changed and why).

## 5. Versioning and delivery modes

Pick the delivery mode by what the project has, in this order:

| Mode | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **A — GitHub** | Git repository with a GitHub remote and GitHub access (§6) | Branch per task, one commit per independent change, push, **pull request** (`Closes #N` when a task exists), review and merge through the PR flow. |
| **B — Git without GitHub** | Git repository with no GitHub remote or no GitHub access | Same branch and commit discipline, **no PR**. Review the branch diff against the base; the final integration is a local merge of the branch into the base (after the user's approval). Push only if the user asks. |
| **C — Other version control** | Mercurial, Subversion, Perforce, Fossil… | Use that system's equivalent of branch/commit (or its native change unit). Same discipline: one change per commit. |
| **D — No version control** | No VCS at all | Make the changes directly in the working folder and record **a copy of every change** in a changelog file next to the refinement document (§5.2). |

Always check the real state first (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, `git remote -v`, `hg root`, `svn info`…). Do not assume.

### 5.1 Branches, commits and version bump (modes A–C)

- Work on a branch named after the task (`feat/123`, `fix/123`, or the project's convention); never commit directly on the main branch.
- The working tree must be clean before switching branches; if it is not, stop and tell the user. Never discard changes, never use `--no-verify`, never force-push or rewrite pushed history.
- Add only the files of each change (`git add <files>`), never `git add .` blindly.
- If the task defines an **order of commits**, follow it exactly. If it lists several unrelated adjustments, make **one commit per adjustment**. Otherwise split into logical, atomic commits. Each commit leaves the project building with tests green.
- **Version bump:** only if the project already versions itself (a `version` field in `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`, a `VERSION` file, a `CHANGELOG.md`, release tags). Make **exactly one bump per PR/branch**, in the last code commit; check first whether the branch already contains one. Choose patch/minor/major from the task's scope (or as the task says). Never create tags or publish packages. If the project does not version itself, skip and note it.

### 5.2 Changelog file (mode D, and as a complement elsewhere when asked)

- **Name:** the same base name as the refinement document, plus `.changelog.` and the **same extension** as that document. Example: `docs/specs/2026-10-14-export-invoices.md` → `docs/specs/2026-10-14-export-invoices.changelog.md`.
- **Content:** a header (task, date) and, for every change made, an entry with the file path, a short description and a **copy of the change** (a unified diff in a fenced block; for new files, the full content; for deleted files, the path and the removed content). Binary files are listed by path and size only. Append entries as the work progresses, in order.
- Never include secrets or personal data in the file: mask them.

## 6. Tooling

- **GitHub:** use the GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) when the session has them; otherwise the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Check availability with a cheap call (`gh auth status`). If neither works, treat the project as having no GitHub access (modes B–D) and tell the user in one line how to enable it (install and authenticate `gh`, or connect the GitHub MCP).
- Run commands from the repository root. Prefer the project's own scripts (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `tox`, `cargo`, `go`, `mvn`/`gradle`…) to detect and run install, lint, typecheck, build and tests.
- Never put tokens, passwords or personal data in issues, documents, PR text, review comments or changelog files.

## 7. Cross-references between skills

The skills of this plugin call each other by their names: `/spec:refine`, `/spec:from-thread`, `/spec:build`, `/spec:review`, `/spec:approve`. The usual path is: `from-thread` or `refine` → `build` → `review` (optional) → the user runs the manual tests → `approve`.
