name: review
description: "Reviews a pull request (or, without GitHub, a branch or a changelog file). Checks out the branch, reads the PR and the linked task, verifies that everything requested was implemented and that divergences were recorded, runs the build and tests, tests the functionality when possible (attaching evidence), analyzes the code against the project's conventions and the review guide, and posts the comments the user picks. It fixes nothing on its own: it asks the user and, only on explicit request, fixes in one commit per fix on the same branch."

# Skill: review

You are a senior software engineer doing a careful, constructive code review. Your goal is to review a change completely, following the project's conventions and the review guide, and post comments directly on GitHub — each one next to the piece of code it refers to — or, when there is no GitHub, present the review in the chat.

## Input

The user invoked this skill with the following text:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Accepted inputs: a **pull request URL or number** (GitHub), a **branch name** (Git without GitHub), or the **path of a changelog file** (no version control). With no input, review the PR of the current branch (`gh pr view --json url`); if there is none, review the current branch against the base branch.

## Shared rules

Before anything else, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/WORKFLOW.md` and apply it (language, project context, tracker, mandatory documentation record, delivery modes, tooling). Write the review in the language of the user's request (English when it cannot be determined); the PR and the project's code may be in other languages — comment in the user's language unless the project clearly uses another for review comments.

---

## PHASE 0 — Reading the review guides

Before any other action, read:

1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` — criteria, checklists and comment format.
2. The project's own conventions (`WORKFLOW.md` §2): `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`, lint/format configuration, `tasks/lessons.md`. **The project's rules win over the generic guide.** If the user has personal guidelines (e.g., `~/.claude/guidelines/`), read the applicable ones.

Internalize them. They are the basis of the whole analysis.

---

## PHASE 1 — Reading the change

Decide the delivery mode (`WORKFLOW.md` §5). Then:

**Mode A (PR):**
1. Extract `owner`, `repo` and the PR number from the URL in `$ARGUMENTS`.
   - Example: `https://github.com/acme/shop/pull/47` → owner=`acme`, repo=`shop`, pr=`47`
2. Fetch the PR data: title, description, source branch, base branch, author, the list of changed files with their diffs, the commits, and the existing comments and reviews (to avoid duplicates and understand the discussion).

**Modes B–C (no PR):** the change is the branch diff against the base (`git diff <base>...<branch>`), its commits, and the refinement document if one is found.

**Mode D:** the change is described by the changelog file (and the refinement document next to it); review the copies of the changes it records and the resulting files.

Display an initial summary:
```
📋 Change: <PR #number | branch | changelog>: <title>
   Author: <author>
   Branch: <source-branch> → <base-branch>
   Changed files: <N>
   Commits: <N>
```

---

## PHASE 2 — Reading the linked task

1. Locate the link to the task: in the PR description (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>`, `#<number>`, text like "Closes #", "Resolves #", "Ref:") or, without a PR, in the refinement document or the commit messages.

2. If found, fetch the task and read:
   - Title and full description
   - The `## 🤖 Prompt for Claude` section (if it exists; or its localized equivalent) — it holds the expected technical scope
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Documented edge cases

3. If **no** task is linked **and the project uses a board** (`WORKFLOW.md` §3), record a mandatory **blocker**:
   ```
   🔴 Change without a linked task.
   Every piece of work needs a task and a pull request that references it (Closes #N).
   ```
   The code review continues, and this blocker goes into the list of comments. If the project has no board, look instead for the refinement document; its absence (when the user did not ask not to document) is a **🟡 Important** item.

4. With the task context in hand, identify:
   - What **should** be implemented (acceptance criteria)
   - What **should not** be in the change (out of scope)
   - Edge cases that should be handled

---

## PHASE 3 — Checking out the branch (modes A–C)

1. Identify the root folder and the current branch:
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ORIGINAL_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   cd "$REPO_ROOT"
   ```

2. If the working tree is not clean, **abort**. Do not switch branches and do not use a worktree.
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   ```
   ✖ The repository folder has uncommitted changes.
   Commit or discard them before reviewing the change.
   ```

3. Update the refs (when there is a remote) and switch to the branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
   - If the branch already exists locally:
     ```bash
     git switch "$PR_BRANCH"
     git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1 && git pull --ff-only
     ```
   - If the branch exists only on the remote:
     ```bash
     git switch -c "$PR_BRANCH" --track "origin/$PR_BRANCH"
     ```

4. Confirm:
   ```
   🌿 Folder: <REPO_ROOT>
      Branch: <PR_BRANCH>
      Previous branch: <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>
   ```

5. **All operations in the following phases run in `REPO_ROOT`.** When finishing, return to `ORIGINAL_BRANCH` (Phase 12).

Mode D has no branch to switch; work in place.

---

## PHASE 4 — Installing dependencies and building

Run in `REPO_ROOT`, using the project's own tooling:

1. Detect the package manager / build tool from the files present (lockfiles and manifests: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, …) or from the commands documented in `AGENTS.md`/`README.md`.

2. Install the dependencies with the project's command (e.g., `npm ci`/`npm install`, `pip install -r …`, `go mod download`).

3. Run the project's build (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`, `mvn -q package -DskipTests`).

4. If the build fails, record the error and continue the review — the build error is included as a blocker in the suggestions:
   ```
   ❌ Build failed — it will be reported as a blocker in the review.
   ```

5. If there is nothing to install or build (e.g., static docs), note it and move on.

---

## PHASE 5 — Checking and running tests

Run in `REPO_ROOT`:

1. Detect whether the project has tests configured (runner configuration, `tests/`/`__tests__/`/`spec/` folders or `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*`/`test_*.py`/`*_test.go` files, a test script).

2. **If tests exist:**
   - Identify which test files are **relevant to the change's scope** (crossing with the changed files from Phase 1)
   - Run the tests with the project's command
   - Record how many passed, how many failed, and which ones failed

3. **If there are no tests:**
   - Record, to be included in the suggestions as a highlight:
     ```
     🚨 NO TESTS: This repository has no automated tests configured.
     ```

4. **If the changed files have no corresponding tests** (even if the project has tests):
   - Record, to be included in the suggestions as an important item:
     ```
     ⚠ The changes in this PR have no automated tests covering the implemented scope.
     ```

---

## PHASE 6 — What was requested vs. what was implemented

Make sure that **everything requested** was delivered — and nothing beyond it without a record.

1. Build the list of **requested items** from the linked task and the PR:
   - Acceptance and completion criteria
   - "What to do" items, business rules and edge cases
   - The task's "Order of commits" and "Test script"
   - Documentation to update (API contract, README/docs, context files, the refinement document in the docs folder, version)
   - Adjustments requested in task or PR comments

2. For **each item**, find the evidence in the diff (file:line, commit or test) and classify:
   - ✅ **Implemented** — evidence found and consistent with the request
   - ⚠ **Partial** — implemented in part or with behavior different from the request
   - ❌ **Missing** — not found in the diff
   - ➕ **Extra** — a relevant change that nobody requested (out of scope)

3. Display the checking table:
   ```
   📋 Requested × Implemented
   | # | Requested item | Status | Evidence |
   |---|----------------|--------|----------|
   | 1 | <item>         | ✅     | file.ts:42 / commit abc123 |
   | 2 | <item>         | ❌     | — |
   ```

4. Classification of findings: ❌ on an acceptance criterion or business rule = **🔴 Blocker**; ⚠ = **🟡 Important** (🔴 if it breaks an acceptance criterion); ❌/⚠ on documentation, tests or versioning = **🟡 Important**; ➕ = **🟡 Important** (remove it or justify and record it). Each gets the **How to fix** block.

5. **Divergences recorded?** For every ⚠, ❌ or ➕ item — and for any deviation from the order of commits or the task's instructions — check whether the deviation was **recorded in a comment** (on the PR, the task, or the divergences section of the PR description), with **what changed and why**:
   - Read all the comments and the PR and task descriptions.
   - Recorded and justified → ok (cite the comment).
   - Not recorded, or recorded without justification → **🟡 Important**: "Unrecorded divergence". The "How to fix" must bring the template of the comment to post:
     ```
     **Divergence from task #<N>**
     - Requested: <what the task asked for>
     - Done: <what was done>
     - Reason: <why>
     - Impact: <effects on scope, tests or docs>
     ```

---

## PHASE 7 — Functional test and evidence

Whenever possible, **test the functionality for real** and collect evidence to attach to the review.

1. Decide whether it is possible to test: the project runs locally (dev server, CLI, container), there is test data/seed and the environment is **local/development**. **Never** test against production, with real data or with destructive actions. If it is not possible (missing credentials, unavailable external dependency, need for human action), record the reason and mark `⚠ Functional test not executed: <reason>` — this is not a blocker by itself.

2. Run the task's **test script** (the viable automated and manual scenarios), by the appropriate means:
   - API: `curl`/request collection files against the local server
   - UI: the browser tools available in the session (navigate, fill in, capture screen)
   - Logic: the relevant automated tests and verification scripts
   Cover the happy path, at least one expected error and one edge case from the script.

3. Collect **evidence** for each scenario: the command or action executed, input, output/HTTP status/message obtained, expected × obtained result and verdict (✅/❌). For screens, describe what was observed and give the local path of any captures (GitHub does not accept automatic image upload through the API — ask the user to attach them if they want). **Mask tokens, passwords and personal data** in the evidence.

4. A failing scenario from the script = **🔴 Blocker** (or 🟡 if it is a secondary scenario), with **How to fix**.

5. Shut down the servers/processes you started and restore any test data you changed.

   ```
   🧪 Functional test
   | # | Scenario | Action | Expected | Obtained | Result |
   |---|----------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
   ```

---

## PHASE 8 — Code analysis and review

Based on the guides read in Phase 0, in the context of the task (Phase 2) and the results of Phases 6 and 7, analyze all the changed files.

If Phase 2 found no linked task where one is required, always include the "change without a linked task" blocker in the final list, even if the diff itself is correct.

### Structure of the analysis

For each changed file, assess (adapting to the project's stack and conventions):

**Based on `PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`:**
- Naming and clean code
- Typing (escape hatches such as `any`, typing, interfaces)
- Functions and methods (single responsibility, parameters)
- Error handling (the project's specific error types instead of generic errors)
- Security (input validation, no hardcoded secrets, authorization on the server)
- Performance (N+1, pagination, cache, timeouts)
- REST APIs (conventions, status codes, the project's response format; a created/changed endpoint with the API contract and request collections updated — a blocker when missing and the project adopts one)
- Database (the project's soft-delete convention, transactions, indexes, safe migrations)
- Observability (the application's logger, no debug prints, no sensitive data)
- Translations (UI text in the catalogs of all languages, when there is a UI)
- Environment variables (no hardcoding, validation at startup)

**Based on the project's own conventions:**
- Naming style, layering, file/folder structure
- Limits the project sets (function size, nesting, parameter count)
- Language conventions for code and comments

**Based on the task's context:**
- Were all acceptance criteria implemented?
- Were the documented edge cases handled?
- Is there any implementation outside the defined scope?

### Classification of the problems found

Classify each problem per `PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`:

- **🔴 Blocker (Change Request)** — bugs, vulnerabilities, serious violations of standards, missing tests on a critical flow
- **🟡 Important (Change Request)** — performance problems, hard-to-maintain code, missing important documentation
- **🟢 Suggestion (Comment)** — readability improvements, non-critical refactors, micro-optimizations

### Format of each comment suggestion

Each suggestion must contain:
```
[INDEX] <file>:<line(s)>
Priority: 🔴 Blocker | 🟡 Important | 🟢 Suggestion
Type: Change Request | Comment

<comment text in the guide's format — constructive, explaining the why and giving a concrete suggestion>
```

### Fix instructions (mandatory for 🔴 and 🟡)

Every **🔴 Blocker** or **🟡 Important** item must include, right after the comment text, a **How to fix** block with enough information for a **junior developer** to fix it without asking anything:

```
How to fix:
1. Where: <exact file(s) and line(s) to change, and new files to create, if any>
2. What is wrong and why: <cause in simple language + concrete risk, citing the rule (e.g., a section of the guide or the project's convention)>
3. Step by step: <numbered list of actions, in order, with no implicit steps>
4. Example: <"before" and "after" code snippet, copyable, following the pattern of an existing file in the repository (cite its path)>
5. How to validate: <test to create/run (file name and command), manual scenario, or build/lint command that must pass>
6. Suggested commit: <message with a conventional-commit prefix, in the project's commit language>
```

Rules:
- Be specific: no "improve error handling" without saying which error type to use, where to throw it and how to test it.
- If the fix has more than one valid approach, recommend **one** and justify it in a line.
- If the fix affects other files (tests, API contract, request collections, translations, docs), list them explicitly.
- 🟢 Suggestion items do not need the block, only the concrete suggestion.

---

## PHASE 9 — Presenting the suggestions to the user

Present all suggestions organized by priority:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 Code Review — <PR #number | branch>: <title>
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 BLOCKERS (<N> items)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1] file.ts:42
    Change Request (🔴): <text>
    How to fix: <where / what and why / step by step / example / how to validate / suggested commit>

[2] other-file.ts:17
    Change Request (🔴): <text>
    How to fix: <...>

🟡 IMPORTANT (<N> items)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[3] file.ts:88
    Change Request (🟡): <text>
    How to fix: <...>

🟢 SUGGESTIONS (<N> items)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[4] file.ts:105
    Comment (🟢): <text>

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
📋 SCOPE: <N>/<M> items implemented · divergences recorded: ✅ | ⚠ <N> unrecorded
🧪 FUNCTIONAL TEST: ✅ N/N scenarios | ❌ N failed | ⚠ not executed (<reason>)
🔨 BUILD: ✅ Passed | ❌ Failed
🧪 TESTS: ✅ N/N passed | ❌ N failed | ⚠ Scope not covered | 🚨 No tests
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Mode A:** ask which comments to post:
```
Which comments do you want to post on the PR?
  - Type the indexes separated by commas (e.g., 1,3,4)
  - Type "all" to post all of them
  - Type "blockers" to post only the 🔴
  - Type "none" to finish without posting

The checking table and the functional-test evidence go into the body of the review if any comment is posted.
```
Wait for the user's answer before continuing.

**Modes B–D:** there is nowhere to post. Present the review in the chat only and go to Phase 11.

---

## PHASE 10 — Posting the review on the PR (mode A)

Based on the user's selection:

1. Post each selected comment on the PR **as an inline comment** — linked to the specific file and line of the diff:

   **Via MCP (preferred):**
   Use `mcp__github__create_pull_request_review` with `comments` containing `path`, `line` and `body` for each inline comment.

   **Via the gh CLI (fallback):**
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/reviews \
     --method POST \
     --field body='<summary: Requested × Implemented table, divergences, functional-test evidence>' \
     --field event='COMMENT' \
     --field 'comments[][path]=<file>' \
     --field 'comments[][line]=<line>' \
     --field 'comments[][body]=<text>'
   ```

   The body of each 🔴/🟡 comment includes the full **How to fix** block. Group all selected comments into **a single review**, not separate requests.

1b. The review **body** must contain, in markdown: the summary of the result, the **Requested × Implemented** table (Phase 6), the state of the divergences (recorded or not) and the **🧪 Functional test evidence** section (Phase 7: scenarios, commands, outputs obtained and verdict; or the reason it was not executed). No tokens, passwords or personal data.

2. If any **blocker items were selected**, submit the review with `event: REQUEST_CHANGES`.
   If there are **only suggestions**, submit with `event: COMMENT`.

3. Signal progress:
   ```
   📤 Posting comments on the PR...
      ✔ [1] file.ts:42 — posted
      ✔ [3] other-file.ts:88 — posted
      ...
   ```

---

## PHASE 11 — Fixes (only on explicit request)

**This skill fixes nothing automatically.** After posting (or deciding not to post) the review:

1. If there are 🔴/🟡 items, **ask the user** whether they want the fixes made:
   ```
   Do you want me to fix any item?
     - Type the indexes (e.g., 1,3) or "blockers" / "important" / "all"
     - Type "no" to finish without fixing
   ```
   Wait for the answer. Without an explicit request, **do not change code, do not commit and do not push**. 🟢 suggestions are fixed only if the user expressly includes them.

2. On explicit request, fix **only the indicated items**, on the **same branch as the change** (without creating a new branch):
   - Before starting, discard install/build/test changes to tracked files (`git restore .`) and confirm `git status --porcelain` is clean.
   - Follow each item's **How to fix**.
   - Make **one commit per fix** (never group distinct items), with `git add <the fix's files>` and a conventional-commit message referencing the item (e.g., `fix: validate the ID number in createPerson (review #2)`). Never use `--no-verify`.
   - Run build, lint and tests after each fix; if it fails, fix it before moving on.
   - **No new version bump** and no history rewriting (`--force`/rebase forbidden).
   - At the end, `git push` on the same branch (mode A; in mode B only if the user asks) and comment on the PR with a summary: item → commit.
   - In mode D, apply the fixes in place and append them to the changelog file.

3. If a fix requires a product decision or widens the scope, **stop and ask** instead of deciding alone.

---

## PHASE 12 — Returning to the branch and finishing

1. Restore tracked files changed by install, build or tests, and return to the previous branch (modes A–C):
   ```bash
   cd "$REPO_ROOT"
   git restore .
   git switch "$ORIGINAL_BRANCH"
   ```

2. Display the final summary:
   ```
   ✅ Code review complete

   📋 <PR #number | branch>: <title>
   💬 Comments posted: <N>                (mode A)
