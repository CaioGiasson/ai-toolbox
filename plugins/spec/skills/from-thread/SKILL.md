description: "Takes a Slack thread link, a Discord conversation link or a markdown file with a conversation. Treats the content as informal, filters out the noise, separates decisions from opinions and open questions, translates it into the project's context, checks what already exists in the repositories and hands a refined task to the refine skill (created on the board when there is one, always recorded in the project docs)."

# Skill: from-thread

You are a senior software engineer and technical product manager. Your goal is to turn an **informal conversation** (Slack thread, Discord conversation or markdown file) into a **refined task** produced by the `/spec:refine` skill.

**The conversation is not a specification.** It is raw input: it contains greetings, jokes, slang, loose ideas, changes of mind, messages without context, informal names of screens and services and implicit decisions. Your job is to **filter, interpret and translate** this into the language and architecture of the project — never copy the conversation into the task.

The outcome of this skill is always a refined task via `/spec:refine`. This skill **does not implement** anything and **does not create tasks by itself**: it prepares the input and drives `refine`.

## Input

The user invoked this skill with the following text:
`$ARGUMENTS`

The input can be:
- **Slack thread link** — `https://<workspace>.slack.com/archives/<CHANNEL_ID>/p<TIMESTAMP>`
- **Discord link** — `https://discord.com/channels/<GUILD_ID>/<CHANNEL_ID>[/<MESSAGE_ID>]` (channel, thread/forum or message)
- **Path of a markdown file** (`.md`) with the conversation

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or matches no format, ask:
```
Provide the thread link (Slack or Discord) or the path of a .md file with the conversation:
```

## Shared rules

Before anything else, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/WORKFLOW.md` and apply it (language, project context, tracker detection, mandatory documentation record, tooling). Write everything for people in the language of the user's request (the conversation may be in another language; translate its meaning, do not copy it); use English when the user's language cannot be determined.

---

## Tools

### Slack (Slack links)

Use the **Slack MCP** (`slack_*`) if the session has it. Check with a simple call (e.g., `slack_list_channels`). If it is not available, show the notice and offer the alternative:

```
✖ Slack MCP not detected.

Connect a Slack integration to Claude, or export/paste the conversation into a .md file and run the skill with the file path.
```

### Discord (Discord links)

Use the **Discord MCP** (`discord_*`) if available (e.g., `discord_read_messages`). If it is not configured, **do not stop**: ask the user to paste the conversation into a `.md` file (or export it) and continue through the file input.

### Markdown file

Read the file with the file-reading tool. No MCP dependency.

### GitHub

Handled by `refine` (see `WORKFLOW.md` §6).

---

## PHASE 0 — Collecting the conversation

Identify the input type and normalize everything into a list of messages `{author, date/time, text, attachments/links}` in chronological order.

### Slack
1. Extract `channel_id` and `thread_ts` from the link (`p1748521234567890` → `1748521234.567890`, a dot inserted after the 10th digit).
2. Read the root message (`slack_get_channel_history`) and the replies (`slack_get_thread_replies`).
3. Resolve the participants' profiles (`slack_get_user_profile`) when it helps to know the speaker's role (PM, dev, designer).

### Discord
1. Extract `guild_id`, `channel_id` and, if present, `message_id` from the link.
2. Read the channel/thread messages (from the indicated message, when there is one) and resolve the authors.
3. If the MCP is not available, follow the guidance in the Tools section.

### Markdown file
1. Read the whole file. It may be in varied formats: `**Name** (10:32): text`, `Name: text`, `> quotes`, Slack/Discord exports, lists or even running text.
2. Infer authors, order and who is answering whom. If the format is so ambiguous that it compromises understanding, ask the user.

### Collection summary
```
📥 Conversation read
   Origin: <Slack | Discord | file: path>
   Messages: <N>
   Participants: <list>
   Period: <first> → <last>
```

## PHASE 1 — Filtering and interpretation (informal conversation)

Apply, in this order:

### 1.1 — Remove the noise
Drop from the input: greetings, thanks, jokes, memes, emojis/reactions without content, "+1", side conversations off the subject, irrelevant bot messages and personal discussions.

### 1.2 — Classify what is left
Mark each relevant excerpt as:
- **Decision** — something explicitly agreed ("settled", "let's do it this way", confirmation from the owner)
- **Requirement** — expected behavior asked for by someone
- **Opinion/suggestion** — a proposal not yet accepted
- **Open question** — a question with no answer or an uncertain answer
- **Constraint/context** — deadline, technical limitation, business rule, reference to another system

### 1.3 — Resolve changes of mind and conflicts
- When a later message corrects an earlier one, the later one prevails; record the change.
- When there is an **unresolved conflict**, **do not choose**: record it as an open question.
- Do not treat a suggestion as a decision, nor silence as agreement.

### 1.4 — Translate into the project's context
- Replace slang, nicknames and informal terms ("that billing screen", "the payment robot") with the project's **real terms** (screen names, routes, services, models, glossary entities). Consult the README, `docs/glossary.md` and the repositories' code.
- Convert vague requests into **verifiable behaviors** ("it's slow" → "listing X must answer in < N s" only if the conversation gives the number; otherwise, an open question).
- Mark as an **assumption to confirm** every translation that involves a guess from you.

### 1.5 — Protect data
Do not copy into the task tokens, passwords, keys, personal data (ID numbers, e-mail, phone) or sensitive excerpts of the conversation. If the conversation contains exposed credentials, alert the user.

### 1.6 — Identify goal, services and tasks
- **Business goal** (1–2 sentences) and the problem it solves
- **Services/repositories** referenced, explicitly or implicitly
- **Concrete tasks** requested

Display:
```
🔍 Interpretation of the conversation (informal → project context)

Goal: <summary in 1-2 sentences>

Decisions:
  - <decision> (by <author>)
Requirements:
  - <translated requirement> ← "<short original informal expression>"
Open questions:
  - <question>
Assumptions to confirm:
  - <assumption>
Discarded as noise: <N> messages
Services mentioned: <list>
```

Ask: `Is the interpretation correct? Adjust anything wrong or missing.` and wait. Repeat until the user confirms.

---

## PHASE 2 — Checking coverage in the projects

1. Identify the current repository. If it sits in a parent folder with sibling repositories, list them and read each `README.md`, plus `tasks/lessons.md` when it exists. Otherwise, work on the current repository only.
2. For each service, flow and functionality from Phase 1, check in the **code** (not just the documentation) whether it already exists, exists partially or does not exist.
3. Display:
   ```
   📦 Coverage in the projects:

   ✔ <functionality> — already exists in <repository>
   ✖ <functionality> — not found / needs to be created
   ~ <functionality> — exists partially in <repository>, needs extension
   ```
4. If **everything already exists**, say so and ask whether to proceed anyway; wait for the answer. If the answer is no, finish without creating anything.

---

## PHASE 3 — Handoff to refine

Assemble the consolidated input and **mark explicitly that the origin is informal**, so that `refine` treats the content as assumptions to validate, not as a specification:

```
ORIGIN: INFORMAL CONVERSATION (<Slack | Discord | file>)
Link/file: <link or path>
Period: <dates>
Participants: <list, with roles when known>

GOAL
----
<business goal, already translated into the project's context>

DECISIONS CONFIRMED IN THE CONVERSATION
---------------------------------------
<list>

REQUIREMENTS (translated)
-------------------------
<list, with the original informal term in quotes when it helps traceability>

OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
<list — refine must take them to the user in its Phase 1>

ASSUMPTIONS TO CONFIRM
----------------------
<list>

SERVICES AND CURRENT COVERAGE
-----------------------------
<repositories involved and what already exists vs. what must be created/changed>
```

Then run the full flow of the `/spec:refine` skill, from **PHASE 0**, treating this input as that skill's input (`$ARGUMENTS`):

- The **open questions** and **assumptions to confirm** go into the questions of `refine`'s Phase 1 (grouped in a single block). Do not repeat questions already answered by the conversation.
- The resulting task and refinement document must cite the origin (link/file) in the context section, without reproducing the conversation.
- The final output of this skill is the **refined task**: the refinement document in the project's docs (always) and, when the project has a board, the **main issue + sub-issues linked to the board** (status ToDo), with the full body defined by `refine`.

When done, display the links/paths and suggest the next step:
```
✅ Refined task created from the conversation

📄 Record: <path of the refinement document>
📋 Main issue: <link or "none — no board">
📦 Sub-issues: <links>

To start the implementation: /spec:build <sub-issue link or document path>
```
