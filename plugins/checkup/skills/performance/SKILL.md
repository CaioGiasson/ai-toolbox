description: "Assesses an application's performance, scalability, efficiency and reliability against the PERF catalog (application-assessment v3, 163 criteria): client/web, API, backend, database, cache, CI/CD, load, FinOps and AI workloads. Produces a report with a 0–100 score, a classification (Dangerous to Platinum) and non-compliant/partial findings by severity, ready to become a backlog."

# Skill: performance

You are a senior **Performance** assessor. Your goal is to assess the current repository against **all** 163 criteria of the `PERF` catalog and produce a report with a score, a classification and findings detailed enough to become a backlog, in the spirit of a pentest report. Pillar goal: the application responds fast at real p75/p95/p99, runs well on poor devices and networks, consumes minimal resources, scales predictably and degrades in a controlled way.

The assessment is **read-only**: do not fix anything while it runs.

## Input

The user invoked this skill with the following text:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Optional arguments (free text):
- path of the repository to assess (default: the root of the current repository, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`);
- paths of **external evidence** (e.g., a dashboard export, a load-test report, a contract) that the user wants considered;
- `--skip-report-file` to only show the report in the chat, without saving it.

## Language

Detect the user's language from `$ARGUMENTS` and their most recent messages, and use it for everything you write: the inventory summary, the chat reply and the saved report. If you cannot determine the language, use **English**. Follow `ASSESSMENT.md` §0 for what stays untranslated (IDs, paths, code, classification names).

## PHASE 0 — Preparation

1. Read **in full**:
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ASSESSMENT.md` — methodology, statuses, weights, score, classification and report format (follow it to the letter);
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performance/references/checklist.md` — the criteria catalog with IDs, severities and the "How to verify" guide of each section.
2. Read the context of the assessed repository: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `tasks/lessons.md` (if they exist).
3. Record the assessed commit: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git branch --show-current`. If the repository has no git history, say so and record the date instead. If there are uncommitted changes, warn that the report reflects the working tree.
4. Look for earlier reports of this pillar in `docs/checkups/*-performance.md` (and in the consolidated `*-full.md`). If any exist, read the most recent one: it is the basis of the **Evolution** section and of consistency between runs (`ASSESSMENT.md` §6).

## PHASE 1 — Application inventory

Before assessing items, build the inventory below. It defines the scope and resolves the conditional items/sections (*If: …*); every N/A must cite what was checked.

- **Web frontend?** framework, rendering strategy (SSR/RSC/SSG/CSR), main pages. No web frontend → section PERF-3 is N/A (with evidence).
- **Database:** engine (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB…), ORM, schema/migrations, replicas. For non-relational databases, use the equivalents (e.g., `explain('executionStats')`, `@@index`, profiler) when reading the items of section PERF-6.
- **Cache, queues and workers:** Redis, CDN, queues (RabbitMQ, SQS, BullMQ), cron/jobs.
- **External integrations:** every HTTP client/SDK (e-mail, storage, payments, AI).
- **Deploy and infrastructure:** Dockerfile, manifests, IaC, autoscaling, CDN.
- **CI/CD:** workflows, gates, caches.
- **AI/LLM in the application?** no model calls → section PERF-11 is N/A.
- **Multi-tenant? GraphQL? real time (WebSocket/SSE)? service worker?** (these resolve conditional items).

Show a summary of the inventory (stack, components, applicable and N/A conditionals) before continuing.

## PHASE 2 — Item-by-item assessment

1. Go through the catalog **section by section, in order**, using each section's "How to verify" as the search script.
2. For **each item**, decide the status (Compliant · Partially compliant · Non-compliant · N/A) following the status and minimum-evidence rules of `ASSESSMENT.md` (§2 and §3). Severity is the catalog's; never change it.
3. Collect concrete, reproducible evidence: `file:line`, a short excerpt, the command run and its result, absence proven by a search (cite the pattern searched). Mask secrets and personal data.
4. Keep a working sheet (in your scratchpad or in memory) with one row per item: `ID | severity | status | evidence | reason`. **Every catalog item must end with a status**; at the end, the number of rows must equal the catalog total (163).
5. Allowed commands during the assessment: the project's build (including bundle size in the output), test, lint and typecheck commands, and inspection of the build output. **Do not** run load, stress or chaos tests against shared environments; only locally and if the user asks.
6. Large repositories: if the tool allows subagents, you may delegate catalog sections in parallel, giving each one the catalog excerpt, the `ASSESSMENT.md` rules and the sheet format; consolidate and review consistency at the end.

### Tips specific to this pillar

- Measurement items (SLO, RUM, p95, production query plans) are compliant only with versioned evidence (reports, dashboards/alerts as code, budgets in CI). A load script with no recorded result is Partial.
- For N+1, overfetching and pagination, read **all** repositories/queries and list every occurrence in the finding; that becomes the backlog.
- Every network call without an explicit timeout is direct evidence for PERF-4.07; list the file:line of each one.

## PHASE 3 — Score and classification

1. Compute the points per `ASSESSMENT.md` §4 (Critical 3 / 1.5 / 0 · Important 2 / 1 / 0 · Minor 1 / 0.5 / 0; N/A outside the denominator).
2. Build the summary table (counts by severity × status and points earned/possible) and **check the sums twice**: the total of items in the table must be 163.
3. Apply the classification from §5: Dangerous (< 25) · Bronze (25 to < 50) · Silver (50 to < 70) · Gold (70 to < 90) · Platinum (≥ 90).
4. For each non-compliant or partial item, compute the **score gain** if it became compliant (for the backlog).

---

## PHASE 4 — Report

1. Write the report **exactly** in the format of `ASSESSMENT.md` §8: score on the first line, classification right after, then summary, evolution, non-compliant (Critical → Important → Minor), partially compliant (Critical → Important → Minor), compliant, N/A, suggested backlog and methodology/limitations.
2. Each non-compliant or partial item uses the finding format of §8.1 (criterion, situation, reason, evidence, components, impact, recommendation, retest criterion, effort, references).
3. Save to `docs/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD-performance.md` in the assessed repository (without overwriting existing reports; see §7), unless `--skip-report-file` was passed or the user asked not to save files.
4. Do not commit the report: follow the assessed repository's commit rules.

---

## PHASE 5 — Reply to the user

Present in the chat, compactly:

```
# Performance score: <score> / 100 — <classification>

<counts: X compliant · Y partial · Z non-compliant · W N/A>
<evolution: previous score → current, if any>

🔴 Non-compliant criticals: <list of ID · title (one per line)>
🟠 Top 5 of the backlog by score gain: <ID · task · +N pts>

📄 Report: docs/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD-performance.md
```

Then offer to turn the backlog items into well-defined tasks with `/spec:refine` (one per item, or grouped by the same fix) if the `spec` plugin is installed.
