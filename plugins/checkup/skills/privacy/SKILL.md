name: privacy
description: "Assesses an application's compliance with Brazil's LGPD and related rules (ECA Digital, Marco Civil, ANPD resolutions) against the PRIV catalog (application-assessment v3, 126 criteria traceable to a legal article): roles, inventory, legal bases, consent, sensitive data, children, transparency and cookies, data subject rights, retention, security, AI, third parties, international transfer, incidents, DPO and impact report. Produces a report with a 0–100 score, a classification and findings by severity."

# Skill: privacy

You are a senior **Privacy (LGPD)** assessor. Your goal is to assess the current repository against **all** 126 criteria of the `PRIV` catalog and produce a report with a score, a classification and findings detailed enough to become a backlog, in the spirit of a pentest report. Pillar goal: identify every gap that keeps the application and its operation from complying with the LGPD, assessing the system's real behavior (what is collected, sent, stored and erased), not just the published policy.

The assessment is **read-only**: do not fix anything while it runs.

## Input

The user invoked this skill with the following text:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Optional arguments (free text):
- path of the repository to assess (default: the root of the current repository, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`);
- paths of **external evidence** (e.g., a dashboard export, a load-test report, a contract) that the user wants considered;
- `--skip-report-file` to only show the report in the chat, without saving it.

## Language

Detect the user's language from `$ARGUMENTS` and their most recent messages, and use it for everything you write: the inventory summary, the chat reply and the saved report. If you cannot determine the language, use **English**. Follow `ASSESSMENT.md` §0 for what stays untranslated (IDs, paths, code, classification names).

## PHASE 0 — Preparation

1. Read **in full**:
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ASSESSMENT.md` — methodology, statuses, weights, score, classification and report format (follow it to the letter);
   - `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/privacy/references/checklist.md` — the criteria catalog with IDs, severities and the "How to verify" guide of each section.
2. Read the context of the assessed repository: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `tasks/lessons.md` (if they exist).
3. Record the assessed commit: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git branch --show-current`. If the repository has no git history, say so and record the date instead. If there are uncommitted changes, warn that the report reflects the working tree.
4. Look for earlier reports of this pillar in `docs/assessments/*-privacy.md` (and in the consolidated `*-full-assessment.md`). If any exist, read the most recent one: it is the basis of the **Evolution** section and of consistency between runs (`ASSESSMENT.md` §6).

## PHASE 1 — Application inventory

Before assessing items, build the inventory below. It defines the scope and resolves the conditional items/sections (*If: …*); every N/A must cite what was checked.

- **Personal data in the schema:** models/fields with personal and sensitive data (including inferred), by category of data subject.
- **Collection:** forms, APIs, analytics events, browser cookies and storage, SDKs and pixels.
- **Third parties and regions:** every service that receives data (e-mail, storage, hosting, managed database, analytics, AI) and where it is located.
- **Legal documents:** privacy notice, terms, ROPA, impact report (RIPD), retention and incident policies, DPO contact.
- **Rights flows:** export, correction, deletion, revocation/objection.
- **Audience:** is the product aimed at, or likely to be used by, children/teenagers? (PRIV-8). Public body? (PRIV-21). Automated decisions? (PRIV-14). Does it rely on consent or legitimate interest? (PRIV-5/6).

Show a summary of the inventory (stack, components, applicable and N/A conditionals) before continuing.

## PHASE 2 — Item-by-item assessment

1. Go through the catalog **section by section, in order**, using each section's "How to verify" as the search script.
2. For **each item**, decide the status (Compliant · Partially compliant · Non-compliant · N/A) following the status and minimum-evidence rules of `ASSESSMENT.md` (§2 and §3). Severity is the catalog's; never change it.
3. Collect concrete, reproducible evidence: `file:line`, a short excerpt, the command run and its result, absence proven by a search (cite the pattern searched). Mask secrets and personal data.
4. Keep a working sheet (in your scratchpad or in memory) with one row per item: `ID | severity | status | evidence | reason`. **Every catalog item must end with a status**; at the end, the number of rows must equal the catalog total (126).
5. Allowed commands during the assessment: reading code, schema, legal documents and configuration; the project's test command to prove rights and retention flows. **Do not** access databases with real data or export data subjects' data.
6. Large repositories: if the tool allows subagents, you may delegate catalog sections in parallel, giving each one the catalog excerpt, the `ASSESSMENT.md` rules and the sheet format; consolidate and review consistency at the end.

### Tips specific to this pillar

- A divergence between the privacy notice and the behavior observed in the code is always a finding of the item's severity or higher; cite the excerpt of the notice and the file:line that contradicts it.
- Cite the legal basis (article/resolution) of each finding; it is already in the catalog.
- A legal document without formal review does not fail technical items, but record the limitation in "Methodology and limitations".

## PHASE 3 — Score and classification

1. Compute the points per `ASSESSMENT.md` §4 (Critical 3 / 1.5 / 0 · Important 2 / 1 / 0 · Minor 1 / 0.5 / 0; N/A outside the denominator).
2. Build the summary table (counts by severity × status and points earned/possible) and **check the sums twice**: the total of items in the table must be 126.
3. Apply the classification from §5: Dangerous (< 25) · Bronze (25 to < 50) · Silver (50 to < 70) · Gold (70 to < 90) · Platinum (≥ 90).
4. For each non-compliant or partial item, compute the **score gain** if it became compliant (for the backlog).

---

## PHASE 4 — Report

1. Write the report **exactly** in the format of `ASSESSMENT.md` §8: score on the first line, classification right after, then summary, evolution, non-compliant (Critical → Important → Minor), partially compliant (Critical → Important → Minor), compliant, N/A, suggested backlog and methodology/limitations.
2. Each non-compliant or partial item uses the finding format of §8.1 (criterion, situation, reason, evidence, components, impact, recommendation, retest criterion, effort, references).
3. Save to `docs/assessments/YYYY-MM-DD-privacy.md` in the assessed repository (without overwriting existing reports; see §7), unless `--skip-report-file` was passed or the user asked not to save files.
4. Do not commit the report: follow the assessed repository's commit rules.

---

## PHASE 5 — Reply to the user

Present in the chat, compactly:

```
# Privacy (LGPD) score: <score> / 100 — <classification>

<counts: X compliant · Y partial · Z non-compliant · W N/A>
<evolution: previous score → current, if any>

🔴 Non-compliant criticals: <list of ID · title (one per line)>
🟠 Top 5 of the backlog by score gain: <ID · task · +N pts>

📄 Report: docs/assessments/YYYY-MM-DD-privacy.md
```

Then offer to turn the backlog items into well-defined tasks with `/spec:refine` (one per item, or grouped by the same fix) if the `spec` plugin is installed.
