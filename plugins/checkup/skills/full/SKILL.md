description: "Runs the complete assessment of an application across the four pillars (Performance, Security, Privacy/LGPD and AI Readiness) using the catalogs of the performance, security, privacy and ai-readiness skills (512 criteria). Produces the four per-pillar reports and a consolidated report with an overall 0–100 score, a classification (Dangerous to Platinum), cross-cutting risks and a single deduplicated backlog."

# Skill: full

You are the coordinator of a complete assessment. Your goal is to run the four pillars on the same commit, produce the four per-pillar reports and consolidate the result into an overall score and a single backlog.

The assessment is **read-only**: do not fix anything while it runs.

## Input

The user invoked this skill with the following text:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Optional arguments (free text):
- path of the repository (default: the root of the current repository);
- paths of external evidence to consider;
- list of pillars to skip (e.g., `without privacy`); skipped pillars are left out of the overall score and this shows in the report.

## Language

Detect the user's language from `$ARGUMENTS` and their most recent messages, and use it for everything you write: the chat reply and every report. If you cannot determine the language, use **English**. Follow `ASSESSMENT.md` §0 for what stays untranslated (IDs, paths, code, classification names). Use the same language for all four per-pillar reports and the consolidated one.

---

## PHASE 0 — Common preparation

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ASSESSMENT.md` in full (§9 covers the consolidated report).
2. Record the assessed commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`, branch); **all pillars assess the same commit**. If the repository has no git history, say so and record the date instead. If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user.
3. Read the repository context (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`).
4. Look for earlier reports in `docs/checkups/` (per pillar and consolidated) for the Evolution section.
5. Build **a single inventory** of the application (stack, frontend, database, integrations, authentication, personal data, third parties, CI/CD, infrastructure, agent context files, AI usage); it is shared by the four pillars and avoids repeated work.

---

## PHASE 1 — Running the pillars

For each pillar, run the complete flow of the corresponding skill (its Phases 1 to 4), reusing the inventory from Phase 0:

| Pillar | Skill | Catalog | Items |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Performance | `/checkup:performance` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performance/references/checklist.md` | 163 |
| Security | `/checkup:security` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/security/references/checklist.md` | 153 |
| Privacy (LGPD) | `/checkup:privacy` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/privacy/references/checklist.md` | 126 |
| AI Readiness | `/checkup:ai-readiness` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ai-readiness/references/checklist.md` | 70 |

- If the tool allows subagents, run the four pillars **in parallel**, one subagent per pillar, giving each one: the pillar's `SKILL.md`, the catalog path, the Phase 0 inventory, the commit and the earlier reports of that pillar. Otherwise run them in sequence: Security → Privacy → Performance → AI Readiness (Privacy uses the Security result in PRIV-12.01).
- Each pillar saves its own report to `docs/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD-<pillar>.md` (see `ASSESSMENT.md` §7).
- Before consolidating, check that each pillar assessed **all** of its items (count equal to the table above) and that the point sums add up.

---

## PHASE 2 — Consolidation

1. **Overall score** = Σ points earned in the four pillars ÷ Σ possible points of the applicable items in the four pillars × 100 (one decimal place). Do **not** use the average of the pillar scores.
2. **Classification** of the overall score: Dangerous (< 25) · Bronze (25 to < 50) · Silver (50 to < 70) · Gold (70 to < 90) · Platinum (≥ 90).
3. **Cross-cutting risks:** identify findings that appear in more than one pillar and treat them as a single problem (e.g., PII in logs: SEC-6.08, PERF-2.14, PRIV-12.06; timeouts and limits: PERF-4.07, SEC-5.14; authorization tests: SEC-3.01, AIR-7.01).
4. **Consolidated backlog:** merge the pillars' backlogs, deduplicating tasks that solve more than one item; the "Score gain" column shows the gain in the **overall score**. Order by severity, status and effort (`ASSESSMENT.md` §8.2).

## PHASE 3 — Consolidated report

Save to `docs/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD-full.md`, with the **overall score on the first line** and the **classification right after** (translate the labels per the Language section):

````markdown
# Overall score: 58.2 / 100
## Classification: Silver

# Full assessment — <repository name>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Assessed commit | `<sha>` (branch `<branch>`) |
| Pillars | Performance, Security, Privacy, AI Readiness |
| Previous run | <file and previous score, or "first run"> |

## Score by pillar

| Pillar | Score | Classification | Non-compliant criticals | Partial criticals | Points earned / possible | Report |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Security | | | | | | [link](YYYY-MM-DD-security.md) |
| Privacy | | | | | | |
| Performance | | | | | | |
| AI Readiness | | | | | | |
| **Overall** | | | | | **X / Y** | |

## Executive summary
<5–10 lines: overall posture, biggest risks, what unlocks the next classification>

## Evolution
<overall and per-pillar score: previous → current; main improvements and regressions>

## Cross-cutting risks
<each risk: pillars and IDs involved, impact, single recommended fix>

## Non-compliant and partial items — Critical (all pillars)
<table: ID · item · pillar · status · reason in one line · link to the finding in the pillar report>

## Consolidated backlog
| Priority | Task | IDs solved | Severity | Effort | Overall score gain |

## Methodology and limitations
<what could not be verified, external evidence needed, skipped pillars>
````

The details of each finding (pentest format) stay in the per-pillar reports; the consolidated report references the IDs and links.

Do not commit the reports: follow the assessed repository's commit rules.

## PHASE 4 — Reply to the user

```
# Overall score: <score> / 100 — <classification>

Security <s> (<class>) · Privacy <s> (<class>) · Performance <s> (<class>) · AI Readiness <s> (<class>)
<evolution, if any>

🔴 Non-compliant criticals: <N> — <the 5 most relevant, one per line>
🔗 Cross-cutting risks: <short list>
🟠 Top 5 of the backlog by overall score gain: <task · IDs · +N pts>

📄 Reports: docs/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD-{full,security,privacy,performance,ai-readiness}.md
```

Then offer to turn the consolidated backlog into well-defined tasks with `/spec:refine` if the `spec` plugin is installed.
